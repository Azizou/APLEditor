An APL Editor for GNU APL

This package provides an editor, written in APL, for editing APL
functions.  It provides facilities that make the creation and editing
of APL functions easier and less clunky than the standard APL function
editor - all without leaving APL.  Lines can be edited without having
to re-type them, lines can be copied and added, and string search and
replace capabilities are available too.


Instructions

See INSTRUCTIONS.txt for instructions on using the system.
